# SOLID Principles: A Developer's Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to our guide on SOLID Principles, the foundation for writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code. This repository is designed to help developers understand and implement the five core principles of object-oriented programming: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.

## Why SOLID?

SOLID principles are crucial for developing software that is easy to maintain, extend, and refactor. By following these principles, developers can avoid code smells, rewrite code less often, and build systems that are more flexible to change.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Concept Overviews**: Brief, intuitive explanations of each principle.
- **Code Examples**: Practical applications in [Your Programming Language].
- **Exercises**: Challenge yourself with exercises designed to test your understanding.

## Getting Started
